Turns out AI is generating a faulty frontend code. I can tell it's faulty, but fixing it myself takes quite a bit of time, and I don't want to overspend time on it ;D
# Shortly:
There isn't much to write here yet - this project is heading towards social media mock or either some kind of messaging app direction.
Once basic functionalities are up, I will provide a readme.

UPDATE: There are room creation/join/leave functionalities. Live messages are set up for rooms. Environment is mostly set up or shortly will for the foundational attributes of socmedia.
